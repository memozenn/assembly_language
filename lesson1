Each family of processors has its own set of instructions for handling various operations such as getting input from keyboard, displaying information on screen and performing various other jobs. These set of instructions are called 'machine language instructions'.
Registers are processor components that hold data and address.
A group of 8 related bits makes a byte.

The processor supports the following data sizes ::

Word: a 2-byte data item
Doubleword: a 4-byte (32 bit) data item
Quadword: an 8-byte (64 bit) data item
Paragraph: a 16-byte (128 bit) area
Kilobyte: 1024 bytes
Megabyte: 1,048,576 bytes


Fetch-decode-execute cycle or the execution cycle ::

Fetching the instruction from memory
Decoding or identifying the instruction
Executing the instruction

When the processor gets the numeric data from memory to register, it again reverses the bytes. There are two kinds of memory addresses ::

Absolute address - a direct reference of specific location.
Segment address (or offset) - starting address of a memory segment with the offset value.
