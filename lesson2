An assembly program can be divided into three sections −

The data Section (section.data): data does not change at runtime, declare various constant values, file names, or buffer size, etc.,
The bss Section (section.bss): for declaring variables
The text section : the actual code.
( section.text
   global _start
_start:)

Assembly language programs consist of three types of statements −

Executable instructions or instructions : instructions tell the processor what to do. Opcode
Assembler directives or pseudo-ops : pseudo-ops tell the assembler about the various aspects of the assembly process. Non-executable 
Macros : text substitution mechanism
