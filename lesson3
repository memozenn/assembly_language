-- Reading data from and storing data into memory slows down the processor. -- 
To speed up the processor operations, the processor includes some internal memory storage locations, called registers.
Registers store data elements for processing without having to access the memory.

-----Processor Registers-----
there are ten 32-bit and six 16-bit processor registers in IA-32 architecture. The registers are grouped into three categories 
General registers,
Control registers,  
Segment registers.

-General registers-
Data registers,
Pointer registers, 
Index registers.

--Data Registers--
Four 32-bit data registers are used for arithmetic, logical, and other operations. These 32-bit registers can be used in three ways âˆ’
32-bit data registers: EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX.
can be used as four 16-bit data registers: AX, BX, CX and DX.
8-bit data registers: AH, AL, BH, BL, CH, CL, DH, and DL.

Some of these data registers have specific use in arithmetical operations.
